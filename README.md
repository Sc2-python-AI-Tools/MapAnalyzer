# SC2MapAnalysis
A standalone plugin for python SC2 api 


Early Stage development,

**you will need to have 64 bit python installed** 

to get an idea of what the api can do,  check out "run.py" 


This module is inspired by plays like this one [TY map positioning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUQsAWIBTSk&start=458)
(notice how the army splits into groups, covering different areas,  tanks a tucked in corners, and so on) 

Hopefully with the interface provided here, you will be able to build plays like that one!

it is meant to be a tool(extension) for [BurnySc2](https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2/)

Thanks A lot to [DrInfy](https://github.com/DrInfy) for solving one of the biggest challenges,  finding rare choke points.

check out his work 

* [Sharpy](https://github.com/DrInfy/sharpy-sc2) for rapid bot development.

* [sc2pathlib](https://github.com/DrInfy/sc2-pathlib)  a high performant rust module with python interface for pathfinding 




Example:
```python
import pickle
import lzma
from MapData import MapData
from utils import import_bot_instance


#if its from BurnySc2 it is compressed
# https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2/tree/develop/test/pickle_data

with lzma.open(YOUR_FILE_PATH, "rb") as f:
    raw_game_data, raw_game_info, raw_observation = pickle.load(f)

# mocking a bot object to initalize the map,  this is for when you want to do this while not in a game,  
# if you want to use it in a game just pass in the bot object like shown below 

bot = import_bot_instance(raw_game_data, raw_game_info, raw_observation)


# And then you can instantiate a MapData Object like so
map_data = MapData(bot)


# plot the entire labeled map
map_data.plot_map()

# red dots or X are vision blockers,
# ramps are marked with white dots 
# ramp top center is marked with '^'
# gas geysers are yellow spades 
# MDRampss are marked with R<region_label>
# height span is with respect to :   light = high , dark = low
# ChokeArea is marked with green heart suites
# Corners are marked with a red 'V' 
```

access a Region like so(region_label is of type int):
```python
region = map_data.regions[region_label]   
```
or,  get a region by quering a point ( for example the position of the enemy ) 
```python
region = map_data.in_region(point)
```

access corners via 
```python
region.corners
```

get ramps, chokes , vision blockers , bases 
```python
region.region_chokes
region.region_ramps
region.region_vision_blockers
region.bases
```
