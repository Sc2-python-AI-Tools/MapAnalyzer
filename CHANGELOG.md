### [0.0.45](https://github.com/eladyaniv01/SC2MapAnalysis/compare/v0.0.44...v0.0.45) (2020-08-10)

### Features

Climber grid (#52)
* feat: get_climber_grid a pathing grid for climbing units such as colossus and reapers
    
### [0.0.43](https://github.com/eladyaniv01/SC2MapAnalysis/compare/v0.0.42...v0.0.43) (2020-08-10)

### BugFixes: 

 * Pather will no longer try to path through mineral walls ( like in goldenwall) 
 * Fix circular import bug on Debugger
 * Fixed malformed point orientation in rare cases 
 
### Tests

* Now testing both installation types (setup.py and requirements.txt)
* Every test  will now use the MapAnalyzer.util functions when it can
* Removed redundant test_map_data from TestSanity,  and put it in its right place,  test_mapdata

### Issues Closed:
 * [#46 Feature Request: possibility to enable pathing through rocks when calculating a path](https://github.com/eladyaniv01/SC2MapAnalysis/issues/46)
 * [#45 Feature Request: Add air grid](https://github.com/eladyaniv01/SC2MapAnalysis/issues/45)
 * [#44 Feature Request: add a setting for a custom default weight for the pathing grid](https://github.com/eladyaniv01/SC2MapAnalysis/issues/44)
 * [#39 Feature : add path_sensitivity for returning a sliced path (every nth point )](https://github.com/eladyaniv01/SC2MapAnalysis/issues/39)
 * [#38 pathfiner should return a list of Point2 and not numpy array](https://github.com/eladyaniv01/SC2MapAnalysis/issues/38)
 
<h2>Code Changes</h2>

### Debugger
 * Now inspects stack and will not save on tests
 * Will no longer circular call map_data for plotting
 
### Pather
* Radius for resource blockers is now 2, this passes all tests

### MapData

* Grouped methods in map_data for better readablitiy
* Moved `get_sets_with_mutual_elements` to utils
* Resource_blockers are now calculated with original coords
* Removed usage of neighbores ,  instead  adding influence with radius
